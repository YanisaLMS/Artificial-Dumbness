## A Search Algorithm for 8-Puzzle:*

Initialize:

Create a PuzzleNode class representing nodes in the state space.
Define a heuristic function (manhattan_distance) to estimate the cost from the current state to the goal state.
Implement utility functions (get_blank_position, get_neighbors, print_solution, print_board) for puzzle manipulation and visualization.
A Search Function (a_star):*

Create an initial node (initial_node) with the provided initial state and a goal node (goal_node) with the goal state.
Initialize an open set (open_set) as a priority queue with the initial node.
Initialize a closed set (closed_set) as a set to keep track of explored states.
Main Loop:

While the open set is not empty:
Pop the node with the lowest total cost (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)) from the open set.
If the current node's state is the goal state, print the solution path using print_solution and exit the loop.
Explore Neighbors:

Add the current node's state to the closed set.
Generate neighboring nodes using get_neighbors.
For each neighbor:
If the neighbor's state is not in the closed set:
Update the neighbor's cost (g(n)) and total cost (f(n)) based on the current node's cost and heuristic estimate.
Push the neighbor to the open set.
No Solution Found:

If the open set becomes empty and the goal state is not reached, print "No solution found."
Example Usage:

Create an initial state and a goal state for the 8-puzzle.
Call the a_star function with the initial and goal states.
The A* algorithm efficiently explores states, considering both the cost to reach a node (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate (h(n)) to guide the search toward the goal state. The priority queue ensures that nodes with lower total cost are explored first.
Note:

The A* algorithm guarantees optimality when using an admissible heuristic, ensuring that the heuristic never overestimates the cost to reach the goal. In this case, the Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic for the 8-puzzle.
